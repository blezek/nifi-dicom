<p>Encapsulation of DICOM queries into a higher level abstraction that supports creation of
a tree model based on the results of a query, and a graphical user interface to that model.</p>

<p>An abstract class {@link com.pixelmed.query.QueryInformationModel QueryInformationModel}
class is supplied that encapsulates the behavior of performing a query using the
supplied information and returns the results as a {@link com.pixelmed.query.QueryTreeModel QueryTreeModel}.</p>

<p>A concrete sub-class {@link com.pixelmed.query.StudyRootQueryInformationModel StudyRootQueryInformationModel}
class can be used to perform such a query using the most commonly supported DICOM query model.</p>

<p>Any such query is based on a list of user-supplied DICOM attribute values used
to define the matching and return keys. A {@link com.pixelmed.query.FilterPanel FilterPanel}
class is supplied that provides a graphical user interface for editing the values of
attributes in list.</p>

<p>A user interface for displaying and traversing the result of a query is supplied,
{@link com.pixelmed.query.QueryTreeBrowser QueryTreeBrowser}, which may be sub-classed
in an application to provide specific functionality when selecting a path in the
tree, by overriding the various methods which return a
{@link javax.swing.event.TreeSelectionListener TreeSelectionListener}.</p>
