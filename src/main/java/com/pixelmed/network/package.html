<p>Classes for sending, receiving, querying and retrieving DICOM composite objects on the network,
as well as supporting lower level functions.</p>

<h2>Package Specification</h2>

<p>Currently the StorageSOPClassSCP supports not only the Storage Service Class as an SCP, but also contains
support for the Verification Sevice Class and the Query/Retrieve Service Class as an SCP. In future this may
change, and the individual service classes may be factored out seperately into individual services and
assembled into user-customizable combinations. As a consequence of the current expedient approach, there
is an implicit coupling between the association acceptance behavior in
AssociationAcceptor.applyAbstractSyntaxSelectionPolicy() used by AssociationFactory and the implementation
of the DIMSE service primitives for the corresponding SOP Classes in StorageSOPClassSCP that is
probably completely inappropriate, and again is likely to be factored out in future. In particular
AssociationFactory will probably in future require more explicit user control over which SOP Classes
to accept or reject. Where possible the current API will be replicated on top of a more robust approach
so as not to break existing code, but this is not guaranteed.</p>
